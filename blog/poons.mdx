The Undertaker defeated The Big Show in the first Punjabi Prison match at the Great American Bash 2006. The Great Khali was originally supposed to face The Undertaker but was forced to miss the event due to illness.

At No Mercy 2007, WWE reintroduced the Punjabi Prison stipulation for The Great Khaliâ€™s match against Batista. The Animal defeated his rival to retain the World Heavyweight Championship.

A decade later, the aforementioned Punjabi Prison match between Jinder Mahal and Randy Orton took place at Battleground 2017. Khali, who has become synonymous with the match type, made a surprise return to help Mahal retain the WWE Championship against The Apex Predator inside the structure.
